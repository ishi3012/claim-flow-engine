Routing Policy Engine Module

This module assigns priority scores and 
recommended work queues to healthcare claims
based on denial status, root cause cluster, 
claim metadata, and payer/provider behavior.

Features:
- Modular scoring logic via `score_claim()`
- Queue assignment logic via `assign_queue()`
- Rule-based fallback engine, extensible for RL upgrades 
    (contextual bandit, Q-learning)
- Supports mock logic for claim complexity, 
    slow payers, and denial clusters
- Ready for integration into routing microservice or batch pipeline

Intended Use:
    from claimflowengine.routing.policy_engine import PolicyEngine
    policy_engine = PolicyEngine()
    routed_df = policy_engine.route_all(claims_df)

Inputs:
- claims_df (pd.DataFrame) with at minimum:
    - denial_prediction (bool or int)
    - denial_cluster_id (str or int)
    - claim_submission_date (datetime)
    - last_followup_date (datetime)
    - payer_id (str)
    - CPT_codes (list or str)
    - claim_type, billing_provider_specialty

Outputs:
- DataFrame with:
    - priority_score (float)
    - recommended_queue (str)
    - debug_notes (list of scoring decisions)
